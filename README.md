# My "cheat" of (spirodonfl)[https://www.twitch.tv/spirodonfl] game.

## WARNING: This currently does not work, something to do with the Speedy2D library, or the most recent version of Hyprland or both

## How this works:
1. You copy the state of the game to the board (U, T, E keys)
2. You click on where you want to be, and the pathfinding algorythm will find a path
3. The app will copy the instructions to the clipboard along with some attack moves at the end

This is not a real cheat, spirodonfl knows about it's existance, and he approves of my attampt of doing something cool. This has been made in 1 night, so the code quality is non existant
